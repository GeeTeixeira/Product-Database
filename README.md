# Product-Database
Interface of my current project. It is a work-in progress, and the code will be uploaded here when I launch its first version.

Main Screen.png: This screen contains 3 buttons. Top button opens "Product search", middle button opens "Current month information+options", bottom button opens "Create new package."

Product search.png, Product results.png: This screen allows user to view all products in the database. Once the are products listed in this interface, the user is able to view pricing details, edit product information(e.g. price, name, description, size, delete product, etc.), and generate sale.
